# Deej system with encoder

In this repository you could find my project to build a [Deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) that have the posibility to be mounted screwed under desk or you can always put your own feets and use it on the desk.

You'll find my 3D models ready to print, the Arduino code (designed to use with any Arduino with keyboard capability to map the encoder keys), another code to also map your knobs as analog controls froma a joystick (not recommended unless you have a clear purpose to this use, because will mess up with other controllers in games) and and scheme of connection I used to build mine.

The design has in mind repairability, making easy to replace potenciometers, which are commonly wear out rapidly with frequent use.
